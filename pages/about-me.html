            <p>My name is Georgina and I am currently a QA Tester at a VR company. A few years ago I found myself lost in the PC-master-race on YouTube, where I spent three intensive days learning everything I could about how to design and build my very own desktop computer. Back then, I was immersed in hardware and I promised myself to connect the dots between hardware and software one day. Fast forward to today, I have read around computer science concepts about the way computers function as well as experimenting with different programming languages such as C and Ruby.</p>

            <p>Professionally, my first role in tech was pre-pandemic as a Junior Strategist. I loved my time researching different markets and looking for opportunities for growth. Then I moved into creating my own agency to focus on using Design Thinking to innovate services for 16 - 25 year olds. It was here that a core skill felt missing from our founding team - someone with technical dev skills. At the time, I wasn’t ready to be the person who brought those skills to the table. Now I feel ready to practise some of skills I have been learning as a ‘baby dev’ and apply them in a business context. I hope to integrate what I have learned in previous programmes, such as agile methodologies and user-centered design, and add value to the projects I’ll work on in the future.</p>

            <p>I have learned a lot through completing my projects. When I first started, I was familiar with basic HTML and CSS, however, JavaScript was completely new to me. What I love most about my journey was that I learned far more than I thought I would by practically applying what I had learned online. I have learned how to use semantic HTML to ‘decorate’ content on webpages, such as legend, section and figcaption; CSS to style my web pages such as using flexbox to create responsive websites; and JavaScript to add interactivity such as dynamically populating text onto pages from object literals. I have also taken the time to learn a little more about how the internet, the world wide web and servers work. This website, along with the links below, are a demonstration of what I have been learning so far.</p>
